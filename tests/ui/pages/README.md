# 🎯 Playwright Test Automation Project

This repository showcases my automated testing project built with **Playwright** and **TypeScript**.  
It includes examples of UI and API tests, structured following the **Page Object Model (POM)** to ensure readability, scalability, and maintainability.

---

## 🧩 Tech Stack

- **Playwright** – end-to-end testing framework  
- **TypeScript** – for type safety and cleaner code  
- **Node.js & npm** – for project and dependency management  
- **Page Object Model (POM)** – to keep test logic separate from UI interactions  
- **VS Code** – as the main development environment
